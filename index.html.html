              <p>Hello. My name is Vinnie Miller.  I am a website developer.  I learned my skills from UCF's Web Coding Bootcamp.  
              </p>
              <p>  
                I have always loved roller coasters. 
                  My favorite in Florida is the Montu at Busch Gardens.  Overall, the best roller coaster I have been on is the Millenium Force at Cedar Point in Ohio.
                  I enjoy playing cards and working on puzzles in my free time.  Growing up, my family always played this card game called Shang Hai.  It consisted of 
                  seven rounds of play, with the objective to be the player with the least amount of points at the end of the game.  If you decide to play, though, be
                  prepared to spend 1-2 hours playing the game.  I have recently started doing puzzles.  The puzzles I find most challenging are the photomosaics.  My
                  family and I have completed two Disney Photomosaics and are working on a third.  
              </p>
              <p>I love theme parks.  Everything about them is cool. Well, maybe I don't enjoy the lines.  For me, the excitement begins when I can see the bilboards as we 
                  drive down the road.  As we get closer, I start to notice the rides and attractions.  The fun  really sets in as we go through the entrance gate.
                  Immediately, we are immersed in a world that is secluded from outside interferences.  Heeart-pounding thrill rides are in sight.  The energy from the
                  theme park employees surrounds me.  We then look at the map to start planning our day.
                </p>
